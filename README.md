## 📌 Overview

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to identify individual appliance
consumption from aggregate electrical measurements. This work evaluates the
performance of classical machine learning and deep learning models on a
high-frequency NILM dataset based on harmonic features.

The repository emphasizes **reproducibility**, providing a unified benchmark
covering nine learning architectures.
